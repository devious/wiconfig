EXAMPLE
      Manually configure a wireless interface

              # sh /etc/wiconfig iwi0

      Automatically scan for wireless networks and, using previous
      manual
      configurations, configure the wireless interface based on the
      strongest
      wireless signal (for use with hostname.if(5) files)

              $ cat /etc/hostname.iwi0
              !/bin/sh /etc/wiconfig -q \$if

      With the above /etc/hostname.iwi0 in place, iwi0 will be
      configured
      upon startup or whenever /etc/netstart iwi0 is invoked.

      wiconfig can also be used in conjunction with apmd.  In the
      following
      example, upon resume, it'll check the status of the wireless
      connection
      and, if there is no network connection, it'll automatically scan
      for
      wireless networks and, using previous manual configurations,
      configure
      the wireless interface based on the strongest wireless signal.

              $ cat /etc/apmd/resume
              #!/bin/sh
              /bin/sh /etc/wiconfig -qs iwi0
